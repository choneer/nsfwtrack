# NSFWTrack

NSFWTrack is a local single-user content record manager / collection tracker.

Current status: `v0.1.0 / Phase 1 MVP`.

Phase 1 is intentionally local-only. It is designed for manual records, local
SQLite persistence, LAN deployment, and simple personal collection management.

## Features in v0.1.0

- Single-user login protection with session cookies
- Chinese / English UI switching
- Local item CRUD
- Tag management
- Creator management
- Item state tracking
- Local title / tag / state search
- Simple stats
- CSV / JSON import
- Complete JSON backup export
- Readable CSV export
- JSON backup restore
- Backup preview before restore
- Configurable backup upload size limit
- Docker Compose deployment
- SQLite local persistence under `./data`
- GitHub Actions CI
- Basic test coverage

## Phase 1 Boundaries

`v0.1.0` is still a local MVP. It does not include external content sources,
crawlers, adapters, remote image fetching, third-party cookie/token management,
automatic sync, multi-source search, random exploration, recommendation systems,
AI assistants, URL backup import, cloud backup, scheduled backup, overwrite
restore, complex permissions, or multi-user support.

## Local Development

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
cp .env.example .env
export APP_PASSWORD='change-me'
export SECRET_KEY='change-this-secret'
export DATABASE_URL='sqlite:///data/nsfwtrack.db'
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` and log in with `APP_PASSWORD`.

For a runtime-only environment, `pip install -r requirements.txt` is enough.
For development and CI, use `requirements-dev.txt` so `pytest` and the
TestClient dependency are installed.

## Configuration

Create a local `.env` from `.env.example` for Docker Compose, or export the same
variables before running `uvicorn` locally.

- `APP_PASSWORD`: the single local login password. Use a strong value on any
  LAN.
- `SECRET_KEY`: signs the session cookie. Use a long random value and rotate it
  if it leaks.
- `DATABASE_URL`: defaults to the SQLite database under `data/nsfwtrack.db`.
- `MAX_BACKUP_UPLOAD_MB`: maximum uploaded JSON backup size. The default is `5`.

Do not commit `.env`. It is intentionally ignored by git.

## Docker Compose

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

The service listens on port `8000` by default:

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

Stop it with:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## N100 LAN Deployment

On an N100 mini PC or similar home server, keep the app on the local network and
bind the Compose port mapping to `8000:8000`. After `docker compose up -d`, open
the service from another LAN device with:

```text
http://N100局域网IP:8000
```

Recommended local setup:

- keep `.env` only on the N100 host
- set a strong `APP_PASSWORD`
- set a long random `SECRET_KEY`
- keep `./data` on persistent storage
- back up `./data/nsfwtrack.db` and exported JSON backups regularly

## Data Persistence

Docker Compose mounts the host `./data` directory into the container at
`/app/data`. With the default `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///data/nsfwtrack.db`, the
SQLite file is stored at:

```text
./data/nsfwtrack.db
```

Keep this directory out of git. For backups, prefer exporting JSON from
`/backup` and also copying the SQLite file while the container is stopped.

## Security Notes

Phase 1 is a local single-user MVP. Do not expose it directly to the public
internet. If you put it behind a reverse proxy, frpc, VPN, or any other remote
access layer, confirm `APP_PASSWORD` is strong first and keep the remote access
layer protected as well.

NSFWTrack does not need third-party cookies, tokens, crawlers, or external
content source credentials in Phase 1.

## Backup And Export

Open `/backup` after logging in.

Available local-only actions:

- Export a complete JSON backup: `GET /api/backup/export/json`
- Export a readable items CSV: `GET /api/backup/export/csv`
- Preview a JSON backup without writing data: `POST /api/backup/preview/json`
- Restore a JSON backup exported by NSFWTrack: upload the file on `/backup`, or
  use `POST /api/backup/restore/json`

JSON backups include `items`, `tags`, `creators`, `item_tags`,
`item_creators`, and `user_item_states`. Restore uses an append / merge strategy;
it is not an overwrite restore and does not clear the current database.

Backup restore only accepts uploaded local JSON files exported by NSFWTrack. It
never restores from a URL, cloud sync, or an external data source. Uploaded JSON
backup files are limited to 5 MB by default.

Configure the upload limit with:

```bash
export MAX_BACKUP_UPLOAD_MB=5
```

## Language

The default UI language is Chinese.

Use the language switch in the top bar to change between `中文` and `English`.
The preference is saved in the session, so refreshing the page keeps the chosen
language.

Direct routes are also available:

```text
/set-language?lang=zh
/set-language?lang=en
```

## Tests And CI

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest
```

GitHub Actions runs on Python 3.12, installs `requirements-dev.txt`, and runs
`python -m pytest`.

Current local test runs may show a FastAPI / Starlette TestClient deprecation
warning from `fastapi.testclient` about `httpx` and `httpx2`. The warning does
not affect current NSFWTrack functionality. It is intentionally not hidden or
worked around with a broad test rewrite; revisit it after the FastAPI /
Starlette TestClient dependency path stabilizes.

## Known Limitations

- Only one local user is supported.
- The app is intended for local network / LAN deployment.
- Direct public internet exposure is not recommended.
- Backup restore is append / merge based, not an overwrite restore.
- There are no external content sources, crawlers, recommendation systems, or
  AI assistants.
- The current TestClient warning does not affect functionality and can be
  revisited after dependencies stabilize.
